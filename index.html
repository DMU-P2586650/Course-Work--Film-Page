    <!--Title Menu: This will be copied to the second page to link the two together.
        I have used a flex display to space out the two buttons on the menu using:

        .menuButtons{
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-around;

        and then decided to use the following css:

        .menuButtons a{
          display: flex;
          flex-flow: row;
          justify-content: space-around;
          padding: 10px 10px;
        }
        .menuButtons a:hover{
          background-color: rgb(40,40,40);
        }
        This changed the two buttons into rows and when hovering over the anchor elements with the curser
        it changes the colour of the content box to a dark grey.

        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Have you ever felt like there was someone watching you? In the corner of your eye you catch a glimpse of something not quite right, somthing off? A shiver up your spine you cant explain? It all has a reason, a purpose. Dana, Curt, Jules, Marty and Holden find this out when their trip to a cabin in the woods isnt the quiet party get away they had hoped for. Something sinister, even corporate, is watching them influencing their actions as the night goes on.  </p>
        <p> Coming out in December of 2011, The Cabin In The Woods is a horror comedy abput a group of friends going on a trip to, as the name suggests, a cabin in the woods.  </p>

    <!--Trailer: I used the following css to make the video centre on the page:

    video{
      display: block;
      margin: auto;
    }

    The display rule allows me to control what type of display the video element is in.
    The block element allows me to place the video in a block, like how the <div> element works.
    This in combination with making the margin auto, which places the video in the centre by
    automatically making the space either side equal,allows me to centre the video properly. This is
    because the browser automatically asigns the margin an appropriate value resulting in the centering
